            <p>This game has a start page, very 80s. You can choose to start or finish. When you select Start, a little man represented by a symbol will appear on your page. But this map is all black. Yes, it's a treasure hunt. You can only see what's around you, which is 1 away from you. You need to explore your surroundings. When you explore an unknown area, that area lights up. Unfortunately, your power is limited. Your walking will cost you energy. If you don't find the treasure before your energy is exhausted, you lose the game. There will be traps or roadblocks as you explore. These things will speed up your energy expenditure. But luckily, there's a lot of food on the map, too. Food can give you a lot of energy. There is also a river in the map. But you have to find a boat across the river. If you find the boat, you don't need energy to sail on the river. Finally, if you find the treasure, you will get a lot of money.</p>
