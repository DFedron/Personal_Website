            <p>Hi, This is Huidong Wang (he/him). You can call me Dong. I am from China. 
                I am an undergraduate student. I currently studying in Portland State University. 
                My major is computer science.  I studied in a Chinese university for two years. 
                Then I came to the United States to study at Portland State University through the 2+2 program. 
                During the two years and four semesters in China, I won the second-class scholarship for four times.
                 During this period, I studied the minor subject of business administration, successfully passed the final examination, and got the certificate of the minor double degree. I also participated in the Youth Innovation Competition (a large competition of entrepreneurship) and won the bronze prize. In my first year in the United States, I learned language in IELP, and received several inspired student certificates, which well supplemented my English ability and helped me to become a bilingual.</p>
